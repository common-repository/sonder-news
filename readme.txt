A WordPress plugin, allowing rapid uploading and publishing of content to Sonder.

== Description ==

Sonder is a free and fair media platform that gives each publisher an equal chance of reaching a large, global audience, while connecting each reader with the best content, personalised to their interests.

This plugin allows publishers using WordPress easy access to Sonder’s publishing API, giving users a quick and easy way to upload their content directly to the platform.

== Installation ==

1. Download the sonder-news.zip file.
1. On the WordPress admin panel, go to the ‘Plugins’ section, then select ‘Add New’ and ‘Upload’ and then browse for the downloaded file.
1. Click on the ‘Activate’ button under the Sonder Publishers Plugin.
1. On the left sidebar, there will be a ‘Sonder Settings’ link, follow that and then click ‘Authenticate to Sonder’. You will now be redirected to the Sonder login page.
1. You now need to make a Sonder account to continue. Once you have made it, you will receive a unique authentication token.
1. Copy and paste the token into the ‘Sonder Settings’ page in WordPress and you are ready to go.
1. Once installed, you can choose either to publish manually, ticking a box each time you wish to send content through to Sonder, or to publish automatically, with Sonder receiving any content you publish to your own WordPress site.
1. Once installed, you can also send through any older content you might want to publish via an .xml file dump.

   An .xml dump can be performed by navigating to the WordPress admin panel’s ‘Tools’ tab, and selecting ‘Export’. You will then be able to download your older content as a compressed .xml file that you can then email to us.

   WP Admin Panel > Tools > Export > Download .xml file > Email to hello@sonder.news
